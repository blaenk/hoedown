[![Crate version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/hoedown.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/hoedown) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blaenk/hoedown.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/blaenk/hoedown)

These are bindings for [hoedown](https://github.com/hoedown/hoedown), the C library for markdown processing, with the intention of being as idiomatic as possible.

I created this because I needed a fully-featured Markdown library (for [diecast](https://github.com/diecast/diecast)) when the nascent Rust ecosystem lacked one.
